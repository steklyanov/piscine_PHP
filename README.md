## PHP Pool (42 School Project)  


PHP Pool is a project for those who wants to learn PHP (as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript and MySQL) form the very beginning. It consists of 10 daily projects (each of them may include up to 20 small tasks) and 2 global projects - rushes (they offer you to create an online-shop and browser game respectively).

All pdf-files with tasks are in the appropriate folders (check files named dxx.en.pdf where xx is the number of day starting with 00).
